  Focus on the quality of reasoning, not just correctness.
  A well-reasoned wrong answer may score higher on some criteria than a correct but shallow answer.

criteria:
  - name: depth
    description: |
      How thoroughly does the response explore the problem?
      Does it consider root causes, implications, and edge cases?
    weight: 0.30
    anchors:
      1: Surface-level only, misses key aspects
      2: Basic exploration, some aspects addressed
      3: Adequate depth, covers main points
      4: Thorough analysis with good coverage
      5: Exceptional depth, explores subtle implications

  - name: coherence
    description: |
      Is the reasoning logically structured and internally consistent?
      Does it flow well?
    weight: 0.25
    anchors:
      1: Disjointed, contradictory
      2: Some logical gaps or inconsistencies
      3: Generally coherent with minor issues
      4: Well-structured and consistent
      5: Exceptionally clear and logical flow

  - name: practicality
    description: |
      Are the conclusions actionable?
      Does the response consider real-world constraints?
    weight: 0.25
    anchors:
      1: Impractical or ignores constraints
      2: Limited practicality
      3: Reasonably actionable
      4: Highly practical with clear steps
      5: Immediately actionable with excellent feasibility

  - name: novelty
    description: |
      Does the response offer original insights or unexpected connections?
    weight: 0.20
    anchors:
      1: Entirely conventional
      2: Mostly standard with minor insights
      3: Some original thinking
      4: Notable creative elements
      5: Highly original and insightful
